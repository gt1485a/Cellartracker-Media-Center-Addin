  <!-- The Now Playing UI in Windows Media Center displays information     -->
  <!-- about the currently playing media. Like Windows Media Center        -->
  <!-- dialogs, the Now Playing UI is owned by the MediaCenter object.     -->

  <!-- The NowPlaying tag is only used for positioning purposes. This      -->
  <!-- means that, unlike all other view items, a NowPlaying view item     -->
  <!-- does not respond to animations and other transforms (like scaling   -->
  <!-- and rotation). Wherever the NowPlaying view item is placed on the   -->
  <!-- screen, the Windows Media Center Now Playing UI will be placed      -->
  <!-- there. It supports some configuration (such as how much information -->
  <!-- to show about the currently playing media).                         -->

  <!-- The NowPlaying tag has a property named SnapToDefaultPosition that  -->
  <!-- can be set if you want the size and location to to match pixel-     -->
  <!-- perfect with the standard positioning inside of the Now Playing UI  -->
  <!-- within Windows Media Center.  If it is set to true and the position -->
  <!-- of the NowPlaying view item has a sufficient amount of overlap with -->
  <!-- the default Windows Media Center position, then the actual Now      -->
  <!-- Playing UI will be displayed in the same position that Windows      -->
  <!-- Media Center uses.                                                  -->

  <!-- By default, the NowPlaying view item has a MinimumSize of 735 x 132 -->
  <!-- pixels, which is sufficient to display the inset and all metadata   -->
  <!-- associated with the currently playing item.  If desired, you can    -->
  <!-- set ShowFullMetadata=Never, and the inset will only require a size  -->
  <!-- of 176 x 132 pixels.  You can override the default minimum size     -->
  <!-- in your markup, but if you set it too small, then the NowPlaying    -->
  <!-- view item may display incorrectly or not at all.                    -->

  <!-- This sample shows how to host the Windows Media Center Now Playing  -->
  <!-- UI in markup.                                                       -->

  <!-- Note: When this sample is viewed within McmlSampler, the NowPlaying -->
  <!--       view item will not be visible. McmlSampler scales down the    -->
  <!--       size of the entire page, and as a result the size of the      -->
  <!--       NowPlaying view item will be smaller than the minimum size    -->
  <!--       and will be invisible as a result.                            -->
