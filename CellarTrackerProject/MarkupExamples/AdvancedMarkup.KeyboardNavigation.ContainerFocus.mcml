  <!-- Container focus sample                                                -->
  <!-- There are two modes that you can specify to override the default      -->
  <!-- focus behavior when entering a container - "RememberFocus" and        -->
  <!-- "PreferFocusOrder".                                                   -->
  <!-- "RememberFocus" indicates that this container should remember which   -->
  <!-- descendant is focused; if you then leave that container and re-enter  -->
  <!-- it, focus will go to the item that was previously focused (if it is   -->
  <!-- still available).                                                     -->
  <!-- "PreferFocusOrder" indicates that when navigating into this container -->
  <!-- the navigation system should *always* treat it as a "default" type of -->
  <!-- Navigation, preferring the item with the lowest focus order.          -->

  <!-- The Main UI displays three rows of focusable items to demonstrate the -->
  <!-- effects of these different modes.  The first row has neither set;     -->
  <!-- navigating from the middle row to the top row will always move to the -->
  <!-- nearest item.                                                         -->
  <!-- The middle row is marked as "RememberFocus" moving from the top row   -->
  <!-- to the middle should move to the nearest item the *first* time.  If   -->
  <!-- you leave the middle row, it will remember which item was focused.    -->
  <!-- If you then move back to it, focus will move to the previously        -->
  <!-- focused item, even if it's not the closest one.                       -->
  <!-- The bottom row is marked as "PreferFocusOrder".  Since the middle     -->
  <!-- item in the row is marked with the lowest focus order, navigations    -->
  <!-- into the bottom row will *always* go to that item, irregardless of    -->
  <!-- where they originated from.                                           -->
